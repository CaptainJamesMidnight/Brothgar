1) Just use the .sav file instead of the .yaml files -- Liquid and Gases and organic things like wheezewort plants don't save/restore very well...

-OR-

1) Import the .yaml files and position/attach them as per the included picture but DO NOT connect power to the Dual LOX plant.
2) Mop up all of the spilled water as required.
3) Vaccuum all of the gases as required.
4) Refill dual chambers with approximately 2500 kg hydrogen
5) Over-pressurize (use fill) the "3KW Powerplant" with about 9999999999 Oxygen
6) Move Dupes to their new home.
7) Connect Gas piping with Insulated Abyssalite.
8) Connect Powerlines as required.
9) Unpause and be AMAZED!

To Do:
1) Get rid of fridges and wheezeworts in the fridge room.   Just use Nutrient bars when you test -- they don't spoil and don't require refrigeration.
2) Remove the Power Transformers.  I'm only using 480kw per line so these are not needed.
3) Since latest update(?) Wheezeworts don't permantely cool Thermo Regulators anymore.   Figure out something new
4) Spend more time with my girlfriend.
